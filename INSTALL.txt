installation: no additional library is required.

DEVELOPMENT VERSION
===================

If you downloaded the sources from our repository, you will need to
download OASIS http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/index.php to create
'setup.ml'.  If you have wget installed, you can then simply do

make configure

to create 'setup.ml' and download the triangle sources from the web.
You can then continue with 'ocaml setup.ml -build' and 'ocaml setup.ml
-install'.  Otherwise, download triangle by hand
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html and unzip it in src/ (so
the files appear in src/triangle).  Then run 'oasis setup' and
follow the instructions of the "Installing" section.
