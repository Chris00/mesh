This is the INSTALL file for the mesh distribution.

This package uses OASIS to generate its build system. See section OASIS for
full information. 

Dependencies
============

In order to compile this package, you will need:
* ocaml for all, doc API
* findlib
* lacaml for executable square_easymesh, executable square_triangle

Installing
==========

1. Uncompress the source archive and go to the root of the package
2. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -configure'
3. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -build'
4. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -install'

Uninstalling
============

1. Go to the root of the package 
2. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -uninstall'

OASIS
=====

OASIS is a program that generates a setup.ml file using a simple '_oasis'
configuration file. The generated setup only depends on the standard OCaml
installation: no additional library is required.

Triangle (dependency)
=====================

The module Mesh_triangle uses the
[Triangle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) library which
was awarded the James Hardy Wilkinson Prize in Numerical Software in
2003.  The command

    make configure

will attempt to detect whether the library is installed, either
globally on the system (this is the case if "libtriangle-dev" is
installed on Debian) or in src/triangle.  It it is not and you have
"wget" and "unzip", it will download Triangle and unpack it in
src/triangle.  Otherwise, you will have to download Triangle from the
above web site and unzip it in src/triangle.

Development Version
===================

If you downloaded the sources from the development repository, you
need to have [oasis](http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/index.php)
to create 'setup.ml' using 'oasis setup'.  Then follow the
instructions of the "Triangle" and "Installing" sections.
