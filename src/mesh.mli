(** Generic mesh structure to be used with various meshers.  It also
    defines some functions to help to display and design geometries.

    General remark: The two dimensional arrays below are described for
    the [fortran_layout].  If you use a [c_layout], they are
    transposed.  Also indices, such as the indices points,
    triangles,..., start at [0] instead of [1] .  For example
    [mesh#point] is of size [n * 2] and the coordinates of point [i]
    are given by [(point.{i,0}, point.{i,1})].

(** {2 LaTeX output} *)

(** LaTex output.  It is given in terms of three macros [\meshline],
    [\meshpoint], and [\meshtriangle] to plot edges, points and
    (filled) triangles.  The arguments of these macros are described
    by comments in the output files.  If you do not provide your own
    implementations, default ones will be used.  The LaTeX package
    {{:https://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/}tikz} is required --
    which works for PostScript as well as PDF output. *)
module LaTeX :
sig
  type color = int
  (** RGB Color representation [0xRRGGBB].  It will be converted to
      TeX by the functions below. *)

  val save : ?edge:(int -> color option) -> 'l #t -> string -> unit
  (** [save mesh file] saves the mesh as LaTeX PGF commands.  You can
      input the file in a [tikzpicture] environment to render the mesh.

      @param edge allows to specify the color of each edge.  If the
      function returns [None], the edge is not drawn.  Default: all

  val level_curves : ?boundary:(int -> color option) ->
    'l #t -> 'l vec -> ?level_eq:(float -> float -> bool) ->
    (float * color) list -> string -> unit

        PGF commands to display the level curves at [levels] of the P1
        FEM surface with values [z] on the mesh [mesh].  Each level is
        a couple [(l, c)] where [l] is the level value and [c] is the
        RGB color to be used to display it. The output is done as TeX
        macros [\meshline{R,G,B}{x1}{y1}{x2}{y2}], [\meshpoint{point
        number}{x}{y}] and
        [\meshtriangle{R,G,B}{x1}{y1}{x2}{y2}{x3}{y3}], so it is
        easily customizable from within LaTeX.  Default values for
        these macros are provided if they are not defined.

        @param boundary specifies the color of the boundary edges given
        their marker value.  Returning [None] means that one does not
        want the border with that marker to be printed.

        @param level_eq an approximate equality for levels that are
        judged not to be distinguishable.  It is expected that [l1 =
        l2] implies [level_eq l1 l2].  This function is mainly used
        not to draw the boundary edges at levels given in
        [levels].  *)

  (** [super_level mesh z level color file] outputs into [file] the
      LaTeX PGF command to display the super-level \{ (x,y) | z(x,y) >
      l \}.  You can customize the output by defining
      [\meshfilltriangle{R,G,B}{x1}{y1}{x2}{y2}{x3}{y3}] and
      [\meshfillquadrilateral{R,G,B}{x1}{y1}{x2}{y2}{x3}{y3}{x4}{y4}].  *)

      function is drawn.

      @param longitude sets the longitude in degrees of the
             observation point.
      @param azimuth sets the azimuth in degrees of the observation point.

      @param edgecolor the name of the color for the edges of the

      color given as [0xRRGGBB] (if [c < 0], then [`Color c] is
      interpreted as [`None]).  The value [`None] removes them.

      @param linestyle is a symbol representing a style of line:
      ["-"] is a solid line, ["--"] a dashed line, [":"] a dotted line,
      ["-."] a dash-dot line and ["none"] means that no line is drawn.
      Default: ["-"].

      @param facealpha the transparency of faces, [0.] meaning fully

(** {2 Mathematica} *)

val mathematica : 'l #t -> 'l vec -> string -> unit

    that running "<<file.m" in mathematica plots the function.  The
